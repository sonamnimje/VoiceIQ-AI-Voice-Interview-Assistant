   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Windows (PowerShell)
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

   npm install
   ```

4. Start locally
   - Backend (dev, reload enabled)
     ```bash
     cd backend
     uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.0 --port 8000
     ```
   - Frontend (typical CRA/React)
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```
   Open your browser at http://localhost:3000 (frontend) and ensure API requests point to http://localhost:8000 or use a proxy.

## üö¢ Deployment

This repository uses GitHub Actions to build the frontend and deploy to Vercel, and Render to host the Python backend.

- Frontend: built from `frontend/` and deployed to Vercel. A working `vercel.json` file in the repo root configures the build and rewrites `/api/*` to the Render backend.
- Backend: hosted on Render and expected at `https://voiceiq-backend.onrender.com` in production.

Before enabling automatic deploys, make sure the following are configured:

1. GitHub Actions secret `VERCEL_TOKEN` is set (create a Vercel Personal Token in your Vercel account and add it under repo Settings ‚Üí Secrets)
2. The `vercel.json` at repo root is not overridden by project settings in the Vercel dashboard (check Routes/Build settings)

CI notes:

- The GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy-frontend-vercel.yml` builds the `frontend` folder and deploys via the Vercel CLI using `${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}`.
- The workflow sets build-time envs `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` and `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL` to `https://voiceiq-backend.onrender.com`.

If you prefer to let Vercel build the frontend directly, remove `frontend/build/` from git and let the workflow or Vercel perform the build. This repo previously contained built artifacts; we've moved to a CI-built approach to reduce merge conflicts and keep a single source of truth for builds.
